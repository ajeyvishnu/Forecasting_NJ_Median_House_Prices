## About the Data

#### About

* Zillow see’s listing nationwide. Taking advantage of the vast amount of listing data, Zillow has been able to produce monthly index for various data point of interest. For this mid-term, we will look at the median home prices for House Listing in New Jersey.

#### Data Source

* Link: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/#median-home-value

#### Data Dictionary

* YYYY-MM: Year and Month during with the data was recorded
* Value: Median Listing Price of properties in New Jersey, USA

## Question and Hypothesis

#### Question
* What will be the best method to forecast the given time series data?

#### Hypothesis
* As we know, House pricing increases with time. It can be a time series with an increasing trend. HoltWinters can be the best method to forecast this type of data. 
* We can check this hypothesis based on the accuracy of each model that we can check below.

## Plot and Inference

##### Time Series Plot

```{r}
plot(NJ_Home_TS_actual, main = 'Median home prices for House Listing in New Jersey', xlab = 'Year', ylab = 'Median home prices')
```

* We start with plotting the time series to visualise and understand the data.

##### Initial Observations

* The plot shows that there is an increasing trend in the median home prices starting from 1996 till around 2006. 
* From 2006 till 2012, there has been a decreasing trend in the home prices.
* From 2012, there has been steady increasing trend till the year 2017.
* The data however doesn't appear to show any seasonal variation.
* If we were to forecast the data, we should be considering the window from 2014.

#### Considering only a window

```{r}
NJ_Home_TS <- window(NJ_Home_TS_actual, start = 2014)
plot(NJ_Home_TS)
```

* Window function has been used from the year 2014 to forecast the data better.
* If we consider the whole data, that might not give us the exact forecast.
* From 2014 it will be more than 3 years data that we are considering and this data should be good enough to be considered for forecasting.

## Central Tendency

##### Min, max, mean, median, 1st and 3rd Quartile values of the times series

```{r}
summary(NJ_Home_TS)
```

* The summary function above gives the min, max, mean, median, 1st and 3rd Quartile values of the times series.

##### Box Plot

```{r}
boxplot(NJ_Home_TS, main = 'Boxplot for the Median House Prices Time Series')
hist(NJ_Home_TS)
Acf(NJ_Home_TS)
```

##### Observations and Inferences 

* The boxplot shows that there are no outliers in the data.
* The Median is more towards the first quartile.
* From summary, we can also see that the median value is less than the mean for the time series.
* This means that the data is right skewed. This can be justified seeing the histogram above as well.
* From the ACF plot, we can see that many of the values crossed the confidence intervals, stating there is a trend component in the data.
* Also, we can see that after 15th lag period, the ACF plot is dipping into the negative values stating seasonality also exists in the data.

## Decomposition

##### Decomposition Plot

```{r}
stl_decomp <- stl(NJ_Home_TS,s.window ="periodic")
plot(stl_decomp, main = 'Decomposition plot')
```

##### Is there a seasonality?
* Yes, the time series is seasonal.
* We can infere this from the decomposition plot above.

##### Decomposition characteristic

```{r}
decom <- decompose(NJ_Home_TS)
decom$type
```

* The decomposition seems to be additive. 
* Because, with as trend increases, we do not see any increase in the seasonality. The seasonality appears to be the same throughout.

##### Seasonal monthly indices

```{r}
decom$figure
```

##### Observations and Inferences

* From 2014 to 2017, the values of the time series seem to increase throughout.
* We can see a peak in Sep 2014 and then a dip and Oct 2014 and then continuous increase.
* Then again a similar case for Mar 2017 and then a dip in Apr 2017 and then a continuous increase.

##### Plausible reasons
* The plausible reason might be because the influx of international students in September their studies.

##### Seasonality adjusted plot

```{r}
plot(NJ_Home_TS)
lines(seasadj(stl_decomp), col="Red")
```

* There are minor fluctuations that can be observed after applying seasonal adjustment.
* With time, these fluctuations will cause deviations and change our forecast. So, it is important to consider the seasonal variation in the data.

## Testing various Forecasting methods for the given dataset

## Naïve Method

##### Output
```{r}
naive_forecast = naive(NJ_Home_TS)
plot(naive_forecast)
```

##### Residual Analysis

```{r}
plot(naive_forecast$residuals)
```

* The residuals appear to have increasing positive values and then peaked in the third quarter of the year 2016 and then dipped down.
* All the residuals are positive. The residuals do not seem to have a mean at zero.
* We can test this hypothesis in the coming tests.

###### Residuals Histogram

```{r}
hist(naive_forecast$residuals)
```

* The histogram appears to be normally distributed.
* But the values do not have a mean zero. The histogram appears to be skewed on one side.
* This means that the data is biased as the mean is not zero.

###### Fitted vs Residual Values

```{r}
cbind(Fitted = fitted(naive_forecast),
      Residuals=residuals(naive_forecast)) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Fitted, y=Residuals)) + geom_point()
```

* The Fitted vs Residuals plot appears to have a trend. The plot slightly shows a straight diagonal line pattern. 
* This means there is heteroscedasticity in the errors which means that the variance of the residuals may not be constant.

###### Actual vs Residual values

```{r}
cbind(Data=NJ_Home_TS,
      Residuals=residuals(naive_forecast)) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Data, y=Residuals)) + geom_point()
```

* Similar to the previous plot, The actual vs Residuals plot also appears not to be random. 

###### ACF of residuals

```{r}
Acf(naive_forecast$residuals)
```

* Values of the Acf have crossed the confidence level meaning there is a trend in the residuals and we have missed some variable in our forecast.
* The Acf values also show seasonality in the plot and we missed this variable too.
* Meaning that naive forecast is missing some main variables which we have missed our consideration for the forecast.

##### Accuracy

```{r}
accuracy(naive_forecast)
```

##### Forecast 

```{r}
forecast(naive_forecast)
plot(forecast(naive_forecast))
```

##### Naive Method Summary

* The ME, RMSE values are very high indicating that this method may not be the right one to go with.
* We can consider more forecasting techniques and check if the error values are less than this one.
* From 2014 to 2017 there is observed to be an increasing trend in the data. So, naive forecast may not be a right way to forecast.
* Rather, we can try naive method with drift component and that may yield us better forecast.


## Simple Moving Averages

##### Simple Moving average of order 3, 6, and 9

```{r}
mavg3_forecast = ma(NJ_Home_TS,order=3)
mavg6_forecast = ma(NJ_Home_TS,order=6)
mavg9_forecast = ma(NJ_Home_TS,order=9) 
plot(NJ_Home_TS, main = "Plot along with moving averages")
lines(mavg3_forecast, col="Red")
lines(mavg6_forecast, col="Blue")
lines(mavg9_forecast, col="Green")
```

##### Observations

* From the plots, it is observed that the higher the order we consider, the smoother the moving average curve in the plot.
* It can be seen that the Green line above is the smoothest compared to Blue or Red lines.
* The Red line (order 3) gives the most real data compared to the other two. The higher order averages smoother the plot and do not give the actual values.

## Simple Smoothing

```{r}
ses_data <- ses(NJ_Home_TS)
plot(ses_data)
attributes(ses_data)
```

###### Observations

```{r}
summary(ses_data)
```

* Alpha = 0.9999
* Alpha specifies the coefficient for the level smoothing. Values near 1.0 mean that the latest value has more weight.
* Initial state: l = 278403.3349 
* Sigma: 940.7005. Sigma defines the variance in the forecast predicted.

##### Residual Analysis

```{r}
plot(ses_data$residuals)
```

* The residuals appear to have increasing positive values and then peaked in the third quarter of the year 2016 and then dipped down.
* Most of the residual values appear to be positive and do not have a mean of zero.

###### Histogram plot of residuals

```{r}
hist(ses_data$residuals)
```

* The histogram appears to be normally distributed.
* But the values do not have a mean zero. The histogram appears to be skewed on one side.
* If the residual histogram doesnot have the mean to be zero, it means the data is biased.

###### Fitted values vs. residuals

```{r}
cbind(Fitted = fitted(ses_data),
      Residuals=residuals(ses_data)) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Fitted, y=Residuals)) + geom_point()
```

* The Fitted vs Residuals plot appears to have a trend. The plot slightly shows a straight diagonal line pattern. 
* This means there is heteroscedasticity in the errors which means that the variance of the residuals may not be constant.

###### Actual values vs. residuals

```{r}
cbind(Data = NJ_Home_TS,
      Residuals=residuals(ses_data)) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Data, y=Residuals)) + geom_point()
```

* Similar to the previous plot, the Actual vs. Residuals plot appears to have some trend in the data.

###### ACF plot of the residuals

```{r}
Acf(ses_data$residuals)
```

* Values of the Acf have crossed the confidence level meaning there is a trend in the residuals and we have missed some variable in our forecast.
* The Acf values also show seasonality in the plot and we missed this variable too.
* Meaning that simple smoothing is missing some main variables which we have missed our consideration for the forecast.

##### Accuracy

```{r}
accuracy(ses_data)
```

##### Forecast 

```{r}
ses_data
plot(ses_data)
```

##### Simple Smoothing Summary

* The ME, RMSE values are very high indicating that this method may not be the right one to go with.
* We can consider more forecasting techniques and check if the error values are less than this one.
* From 2014 to 2017 there is observed to be an increasing trend in the data. So, this forecast may not be a right way to forecast.
* We can try Holtwinters approach as it suits for trend+seasonal time series.

## Holt-Winters 

```{r}
HW_forecast <- hw(NJ_Home_TS, seasonal = "additive")
plot(forecast(HW_forecast))
attributes(HW_forecast)
hw_add <- forecast(HW_forecast)
```

* Here, additive Holtwinters method is considered.
* This is because the seasonality isn't increasing with trend. This is an additive time series.

###### Observations

```{r}
hw_add$model
```

* Alpha = 0.8088. Alpha specifies the coefficient for the level smoothing in Holtwinters.
* Beta = 00952. Beta specifies the coefficient for the trend smoothing in Holtwinters. 
* Gamma = 0.1901. Gamma specifies the coefficient for the seasonal smoothing in Holtwinters.
* Values 1.0 means that the latest value has highest weight.
* Initial states:
    l = 278262.0665 
    b = 562.8731 
    s = 155.2537 257.43 199.9368 112.0836 924.0918 418.237
           -164.0516 -47.7212 -248.0368 -609.1925 45.5616 -1043.592
* Sigma = 878.616. Sigma defines the variance of the forecast values.

##### Residual Analysis

```{r}
plot(hw_add$residuals)
```

* The residuals appear to be random and also the mean looks to be near zero. We can check this with histogram.
* We can observe a couple of up and downs throughout. But even they did not show and growing residual pattern.

###### Histogram plot of residuals

```{r}
hist(hw_add$residuals)
```

* The histogram appears to be normally distributed.
* And the mean is near zero. Indicating the data is not biased.
* Overall, comparing the previous forecasts, this forecast appears to be the best till now. 

###### Fitted values vs. residuals

```{r}
cbind(Fitted = fitted(hw_add),
      Residuals=residuals(hw_add)) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Fitted, y=Residuals)) + geom_point()
```

* The Fitted vs Residuals plot appears not to have any trend.
* This means there is no heteroscedasticity in the errors which means that the variance of the residuals is constant.

###### Actual values vs. residuals

```{r}
cbind(Data = NJ_Home_TS,
      Residuals=residuals(hw_add)) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Data, y=Residuals)) + geom_point()
```

* Similar to the previous plot, the Actual vs. Residuals plot appears to be random.

###### ACF plot of the residuals

```{r}
Acf(hw_add$residuals)
```

* In the Acf plot, none of the values crossed the confidence levels. It appears to be white noice.
* This signifies that the forecast is a good forecast.
* This proves to be the best forecast comparing all the previous ones tested.

##### Accuracy

```{r}
accuracy(hw_add)
```

##### Forecast 

```{r}
forecast(HW_forecast)
plot(forecast(HW_forecast))
```

##### Holtwinters Summary
* The ME, RMSE values are quite low compared to any of our previous forecasts.
* Holwinters is a better forecast compared to naive and simple smoothing.
* Holtwinters appears to be the best forecast considering all the previous forecast methods.
* However, this forecast can still be improved as we can try forecasting using ARIMA models.

## Accuracy Summary

```{r}
accuracy(naive_forecast)
accuracy(ses_data)
accuracy(hw_add)
```

##### Best & Worst Forecasts

* To start with, there is nothing like best or worst forecast.
* Considering the accuracy data above, HoltWinters forecast seems to fit the time series the best as it has the least error values.
* And naive forecast seems to be the worst as it has the largest ME and RMSE values.

## Conclusion

* The data seemed to have trend and seasonality initially and we checked the same with Acf and confirmed it.
* Based on the three forecasting methods naive, simple smoothing, and HoltWinters, we can see that HoltWinters forecast provides to be the better forecasting method in this case.
* This is because the forecast fits perfectly and also the error values are quiet low for HoltWinters forecast.
* Additionally residuals in HoltWinters appear to be random and the all the ACF values of residuals are within the confidence interval.
* This shows that our hypothesis is correct based on the accuracy of all the models.
* Based on the analysis and forecast, the time series will increase over the next year and the next 2 years.
